**The Problem**
The Problem: Fragmented Campus Life Despite being hyper-connected, students suffer from information isolation. Critical academic alerts are buried in informal WhatsApp spam, creating a "Signal-to-Noise" problem. Simultaneously, a lack of a trusted internal marketplace leads to massive resource wastage, as seniors discard expensive books while juniors struggle to afford them. Finally, the "Mentorship Gap" remains wide, as formal networks like LinkedIn feel too intimidating for casual student-alumni guidance.

The Solution: Campuz – The Unified Campus Ecosystem Campuz is a hyper-local, verified platform that consolidates student life into a single secure loop. It solves communication by replacing spammy chats with a visual, categorized Event Feed. It tackles wastage with a Circular Resource Marketplace, allowing seamless peer-to-peer sharing of notes and tools. All of this is enclosed in a secure environment accessible only via Institutional Email, creating a verified trust circle for students and alumni.
